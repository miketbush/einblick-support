# Einblick Support Tools
![](screenshots/eccoselect-logo.png)

### [Ecco Select](https://www.eccoselect.com/) presents a tool set created to facilitate the collection of support data from a on-prem Einblick install. The support data, support-bundle, is then compressed and sent to an S3 bucket, typically provided by Einblick for diagnostic data. This data will include any number of internal MongoDB collections, if desired.  Additionally, the tools include a mini-monitor to collect data immediately, should a UI crash occur and a web view of the log data. This web view allows on-site staff to gain insight into the issues encountered and possible solutions as well.


## Requirements:

### Krew Tools:

#### Installation
curl https://krew.sh/support-bundle | bash<br>
if you don't want it installed in ~/.krew, create symlink at ~/.krew pointed elsewhere first.<br>

  wget https://fastdl.mongodb.org/tools/db/mongodb-database-tools-rhel70-x86_64-100.6.0.tgz<br>
  tar -xzf mongodb-database-tools-rhel70-x86_64-100.6.0.tgz<br>
  mv mongodb-database-tools-rhel70-x86_64-100.6.0 /app/support/mongotools<br>

## Einblick Auto Support Bundle Tool

### Description:

This tool is used to extract support information and logs from the kubernetes instance of Einblick. These support bundles must be sent to Einblick for analysis. Historically, this task was
manual, needing to use the Einblick Administrative Console UI to generate and download the support file from a browser. Additionally, a manual step of attaching and sending by email was
needed. The new process extracts the support information and uploads them to an Einblick provided S3 bucket, eliminating the need for any manual intervention.


### Tool Arguments:

/app/support/einblick-support-bundle.sh USER_KEY USER_SECRET S3_FOLDER<br>
USER_KEY – Amazon User Key<br>
USER_SECRET – Amazon User Secret<br>
S3_FOLDER – Destination Folder in S3 bucket<br>


### scheduled.log:

```
Log for the scheduled job output
```
### support-bundle.log:

```
Log for the kubectl support bundle generation output
```
### support-bundle-*.gz:


```
Support bundle file to send
```
### Crontab Entry for Support Bundle:

5 6,10,14,16,18 * * 1,2,3,4,5 /app/support/einblick-support-bundle.sh KEY SECRET scheduled &> /app/support/scheduled.log

#### Scheduled:

```
5 6,10,14,16,18 * * 1,2,3,4,5 == “At minute 5 past hour 6, 10, 14, 16, and 18 on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.”
```
### Crontab Entry for UI Monitor:

*/5 * * * * /app/support/einblick-monitor.sh KEY SECRET monitored &> /app/support/monitor.log

#### Scheduled:

```
*/5 * * * * == “Every 5 minutes”
```

### Einblick Support Log Server:

To provide better ease and visibility to the Einblick logs, a python-based Flask server can be used to server the logs in a convenient web based format.  The server will pull the data from the last run of the log support bundle extraction process and generate an index page for the logs that exist.  You can then view all the logs generated by Einblick from the browser.  For ease of use create a virtual python environment and install Flask with pip.
#### Starting Example Log Server:


##### Change to server directory:

```
cd /app/support/server
```
##### Activate Virtual Environment:

```
source env/bin/activate  
```
##### Start Flask Server in the Background:

```
python server_logs.py &
```

#### URL:

http://my.server:18080/index.html
